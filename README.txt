AI that can find solutions to bloxorz maps that doesnt consist gates. I have not used any heuristic search methods. 
Tree structure is used to hold the data of the moves, and 2D linkedlist to hold map data.
Tree setup and search methods are recursively operating.
Please don't hesitate to contribute :)
